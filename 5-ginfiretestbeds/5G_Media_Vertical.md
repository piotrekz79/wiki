## 5G Media Vertical

The TNO 5G Media Vertical testbed extends the 5GINFIRE infrastructure with a new, state of the art, testbed facility targeted at the 5G Media Vertical industry. This facility will be complemented with several functionalities that will be needed to enable the execution of media use cases beyond the state of the art of what is possible today. Specifically, we look at two target areas: (i) 6-degrees-of-freedom (6DoF) VR streaming, where users can move in the virtual world, and (ii) professional video production (uplink streaming) for live TV. The first class of use cases require close-to-zero network latency, while the second class of use cases need stable and high quality upload links. To enable these classes of use cases, the TNO 5G Media Vertical testbed brings the following media-specific 5G/cloud functionalities: Network assistance, Edge processing, 3rd party monitoring / managing APIs, Automated, reproduceable testing framework.
